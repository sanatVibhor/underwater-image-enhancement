Color Balance and Fusion for Underwater Image Enhancement



read me abstract

We introduce an effective technique to enhance the
images captured underwater and degraded due to the medium
scattering and absorption. Our method is a single image approach
that does not require specialized hardware or knowledge about
the underwater conditions or scene structure. It builds on the

blending of two images that are directly derived from a color-
compensated and white-balanced version of the original degraded

image. The two images to fusion, as well as their associated weight
maps, are defined to promote the transfer of edges and color
contrast to the output image. To avoid that the sharp weight map
transitions create artifacts in the low frequency components of the
reconstructed image, we also adapt a multiscale fusion strategy.
Our extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation reveals that
our enhanced images and videos are characterized by better
exposedness of the dark regions, improved global contrast, and
edges sharpness. Our validation also proves that our algorithm
is reasonably independent of the camera settings, and improves
the accuracy of several image processing applications, such as
image segmentation and keypoint matching.
